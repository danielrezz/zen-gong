<h2>Background</h2>

<p>Admittedly, I have been having a hard time with programming and obtaining a job within the industry. This stuff isn't quite as easy as I thought it would be. Once I seem to understand concepts or feel comfortable with my skills, I go into an interview or start a project and all of a sudden I know absolutely nothing. It starts taking a toll on my brain.
<br>
I decided to make this small, simple app to prove to myself that I can create something. Anything! It provides the user with some positive messages once they hit the gong. Sweet and simple. I can't wait to expand on these skills.

<h2>Code and Skills Used</h2>

<p>This app was made using the <a href="https://github.com/misselliev/affirmations-api">Dulce-Affirmations-API</a>. I loved how easy it was to implement using the Fetch API. Once I was able to retrieve the affirmations, the rest was just all design.
<br>
I was also able to experiment a little bit with the Audio constructor in order to implement a gong sound once the button is clicked. I had a drone in there too, but decided to keep it simple.
